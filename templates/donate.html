                            <i> A People development and research organization </i>
  <br>

<p>	Emergence of Social Institute can not be traced back with its present name and identity when it was only an organized movement of landless poor people in Char Gazaria . River-eroded people organized against  tyranny of Jotdars. Social Institute is regarded there as a movement- a movement of the landless people. Under the leadership of the Executive Director Mr A. B. M. Osman Gani, presently an Ashoka fellow, Social Institute came out successful in arranging distribution of 1.5 acre of Khas (Gov’t) land for each of 1740 landless people.

	In utter untoward setting, the landless people started cultivating this land braving the threats of the lathials (armies kept by the feudal lords). 74 poor settlers (including 8 volunteers of Social Institute) had to lay down their lives. Innumerable members of the settlers and a good number of Social Institute’s volunteers had to fall victims of the conspiracy of the local Jotders and musclemen.

	With the victory of the landless and the destitute, the realization of an organization for themselves got the shape of a reality. In 1978, the first step towards developing a platform of the landless initiated through formation of a cooperative. Later through different phases, Social Institute finally formed in 1980 when it needed to legally initiate a protest against a Govt. ban on cultivation on Char Gazaria. The background is thus chequered with its redistribution approach of the rural resources like Khas (Govt.) lands, water bodies, etc.

	The emergence is distinctly characterized because organized community established its platform, unlike the case of many other organizations that emerged to address problems of particular community. Amidst trials and tribulation were born the pressure groups and they collectively counter the feudals and the inhuman torture of their henchmen, trump up criminal cases against them and other untold miseries and harrassments. Social Institute all along has been facilitating the movement.

	Organising the local landless people in a bid to realise their rights and to empower them socio-economically has all along been on the prioritized agenda of Social Institute. Social Institute directs its action with following objectives :

•	To establish the rights of the landless people on Khaslands by themselves by motivating them and organising them into pressure groups;

•	To empower the landless target people by creating income generating projects for them and raising skills and awareness among them through training;

•	To help build a conscious and effective movement against anti-people land and agriculture reform;

	River-eroded and flood-affected landless people comprise the major target group of Social Institute. Presently it works in coastal-belt islands and Char lands, particularly of Bhola and Luxmipur district. Besides, it has expanded its programmes in following other areas:

1. Khoksha Thana of Chuadanga District	2. Mollarhat Thana of Bagerhat
3. Damurbuda Thana  of Kustia 4. Bakerganj Thana Barisal

	Social Institute holds that without land and agriculture reforms, sustainable national development cannot be achieved. Social Institute identifies itself with all landless, river-eroded people in a their struggle for a pro-people land reform in Bangladesh.

	 Programmes of organizing and mobilizing landless and marginal farmers for Khasland is expanded to include agricultural activities in order to respond to local demands. Starting from mere collective fights for basic human rights, the programme now include to a comprehensive socioeconomic development one with components of Training, Education, Social awareness, Eco-friendly agriculture, Credit and so on. Social Institute is the only development partner of the inhabitants in Char Gazaria. Social uplift programmes in Char Gazaria include in particular:

Organising Landless People

Credit Support

Sustainable Agriculture

Social Forestation

Awareness Training on Health and Nutrition

Water and Sanitation Program

Reproductive health-infant mortality and safe motherhood, prevention and control of the HIV/AIDS

Arsenic Mitigation Program

Lobbying, Advocacy and campaign programme for (national level) land and agriculture reform

Legal Aid for Poor Settlers

Skill Training on Various Vocational Trades

Empowering women, Gender Relation & Group approach to Development

Disaster Management & Emergency Relief and Rehabilitation Support

Construction of Cyclone Centers

Assistance for Upgrading Communication & Transportation in Char Area


	Social Institute organized the people receiving allotted land, constructed Killa (high heap of land for shelter during flooding), cyclone shelter, schools, bridges, roads for the islanders. Absence of any development agencies and Govt. support compels Social Institute to provide for all necessary assistance.

	Social Institute has a noble intention to proclaim the achievement it earned in land distribution at Char Gazaria throughout the country. Accordingly, Social Institute runs a national level policy advocacy and lobbying programme for land and agriculture reform in Bangladesh.

	Human resource development, health care service, advocacy programme and poverty alleviation are the major tasks of Social Institute. The key and ultimate mission of this organization is to establish the right and rehabilitation of the destitute landless people on khasland, dwelling in Char and embankment especially in remote rural areas where Govt. and NGOs have least efforts towards development. Social Institute has been moving towards reaching its optimum goals with dedicated manpower and available resources to carry out its long-term commitment through various programs and activities with sincere efforts.

                        The distinct achievement of Social Institute has earned the life-long fellowship award for its Executive Director from Ashoka Innovators for the Public, USA.  </p>
